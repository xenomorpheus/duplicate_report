Duplicate File Reporting - Simple Perl Script
==============================================

This script is designed to be as simple and portable as possible.
It should run on most systems.

  ./duplicate_report.pl --dir my_dir1 

  ./duplicate_report.pl --dir my_dir1 --dir my_dir2

Hint:
When reporting duplicates, the file found first will be reported as the original,
so order the directories on the command line with preferred directories first.
